## About me

I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). Before joining CUHK-Shenzhen, I was a senior researcher and tech lead at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](http://research.baidu.com/Research_Areas/index-view?id=75), Baidu, from 2020 to 2023. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Norbert Lütkenhaus](https://lutkenhausgroup.wordpress.com/)’s optical quantum communication theory group, at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC), University of Waterloo. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge, where I worked with [Hamza Fawzi](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hf323/). I received my PhD degree in quantum information from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS:QSI) in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. [Runyao Duan](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/runyao.duan) and Prof. [Mingsheng Ying](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/mingsheng.ying).

My research focuses on quantum information science, an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. 
My expertise lies in understanding the capabilities and limitations of quantum resources, as well as their usage in quantum computation and quantum communication. 

I am deeply interested in the mathematical foundations and optimization techniques of quantum information theory. I am also dedicated to the field of quantum software engineering, with a focus on bridging the gap between scientific advancements and functional products that can benefit both industry and society.

**2023/12**, our submission *A new entanglement conversion distance for a complete characterization of entanglement embezzlement and closed-form expressions for entanglement distillation and dilution* has been accepted as a talk at QIP 2024 (with Thomas Theurer and Gilad Gour).

**2023/12**, our new paper *Single-shot Entanglement Manipulation of States and Channels Revisited* (with Thomas Theurer and Gilad Gour) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17088).

**2023/10**, our new paper *Symmetry-Based Quantum Circuit Mapping* (with Di Yu) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18026).

**2023/10**, our new paper *Dynamic Quantum Circuit Compilation* (with Munan Zhang, Ruqi Shi and Yinan Li) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11021). It provides a systematic study of dynamic quantum circuit compilation, a process that transforms static quantum circuits into their dynamic equivalents with a reduced qubit count through qubit-reuse.

**2023/07**, our paper *Quantum NETwork: from theory to practice* (with  Jingtian Zhao, Xiufan Li, Yifei Li and Runyao Duan) has been accepted by [Science China Information Sciences](http://scis.scichina.com/en/2023/180509.pdf) (CCF-A journal).

**2023/02**, I was invited to serve as a **program committee member for [AQIS 2023](http://aqis-conf.org/2023/committees/)**, a leading conference in quantum information science.

**2022/12**, our new paper *Quantum NETwork: from theory to practice* (with  Jingtian Zhao, Xiufan Li, Yifei Li and Runyao Duan) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01226). It provides an up-to-date review of the field of quantum networks from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, and introduces a newly developed quantum network toolkit (QNET) to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of innovative ideas.

**2022/03**, our new paper *Finite-Key Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution with Characterized Devices Using Entropy Accumulation* (with Ian George, Jie Lin, Thomas van Himbeeck, and Norbert Lütkenhaus) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06554).

**2021/10**, our new paper *Ultimate Limits of Quantum Channel Discrimination* (with Gilad Gour and Xin Wang) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14842).

**2021/05**, our works *No-Go Theorems for Quantum Resource Purification & No-Go Theorems for Quantum Resource Purification: New Approach and Channel Theory* (with Zi-Wen Liu) have been accepted as a talk at TQC 2021.
