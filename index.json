internet is envisioned as the ultimate stage of the quantum revolution, which surpasses its classical counterpart in various aspects, such as the efficiency of data transmission, the security of network services, and the capability of information processing. Given its disruptive impact on the national security and the digital economy, a global race to build scalable quantum networks has already begun. With the joint effort of national governments, industrial participants, and research institutes, the development of quantum networks has advanced rapidly in recent years, bringing the first primitive quantum networks within reach. In this work, we aim to provide an up-to-date review of the field of quantum networks from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, contributing to a better understanding of the building blocks required for the establishment of a global quantum internet. We also introduce a newly developed quantum network toolkit to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of innovative ideas. Particularly, it provides dual quantum computing engines, supporting simulations in both the quantum circuit and measurement-based models. It also includes a compilation scheme for mapping quantum network protocols onto quantum circuits, enabling their emulations on real-world quantum hardware devices. We showcase the power of this toolkit with several featured demonstrations, including a simulation of the Micius quantum satellite experiment, a testing of a four-layer quantum network architecture with resource management, and a quantum emulation of the CHSH game. We hope that this work can give a better understanding of the state-of-the-art development of quantum networks and provide the necessary tools to make further contributions along the way.

My research area is quantum information science, which is a rapidly growing field that demands interdisciplinary knowledge in quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. This field aims to harness quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence to enhance our capabilities for computation and communication. However, to turn the theoretically blueprinted quantum advantages into practice, a deep understanding of what can and cannot be done with these resources is required, along with a systematic strategy to translate these theories into engineering products. My research focuses on addressing the critical challenges in quantum information science by exploring the capabilities and limitations of various quantum resources. I also strive to translate these theories into engineering products that can benefit both industry and society. My experience as a quantum researcher and software engineer has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the grand journey towards quantum industrialization. In the following, I will provide an overview of my research. ","date":"2023-08-22","objectID":"/research/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/research/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Resource benchmarks for quantum technology Quantum technology is believed to be much more powerful than conventional technology in many cases. One of the main drivers of its superior performance is the effective utilization of quantum resources. These resources, analogous to fuel for a car, play a critical role in all kinds of quantum technologies, such as magic states for fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum channels for quantum communication, and quantum entanglement for quantum networking. However, these quantum resources are inherently fragile and vulnerable to noise effects induced by environmental factors, imperfect controls and unstable memories, severely compromising the accuracy, efficiency, and security of computation and communication tasks. To address this challenge, a standard approach known as quantum resource distillation has emerged. This process involves transforming a large amount of noisy resource into a smaller amount of pure resource, similar to the process of reducing a dilute solution to a more concentrated one. Alongside this approach, two fundamental questions have been extensively investigated over the past two decades in the quantum community: How much noisy resource should we invest at least to obtain a fixed amount of pure resource? How much pure resource can we obtain at most from a fixed amount of noisy resource? A deeper understanding of these questions can provide invaluable insights into the resource cost of overcoming quantum noise, benchmark state-of-the-art protocols, and ultimately remove the barriers to scaling quantum computers and quantum networks. Therefore, the main focus of my research has been on finding answers to these questions. A universal law for quantum resource distillation (QIP talk1) The celebrated no-cloning theorem2 and no-deleting theorem3 similarly revealed no-go rules of information processing stemming from the basic laws of quantum mechanics and have had a profound impact on the development of quantum technologies. In the same spirit, my work [FL20-PRL]4 proposed the first no-go theorem for quantum resource distillation, which universally applies to any reasonable resource theory, demonstrating that the production of any pure resource state with an arbitrarily small error is generically prohibited. We also established a quantitative trade-off between the accuracy and success probability of resource distillation, closely resembling the well-known uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics and drawing practical boundaries for quantum error processing. This work has been highlighted as an Editors' Suggestion in Physical Review Letters, placing it in the top 15% of all accepted papers, due to its particular importance, innovation, and broad appeal. Subsequently, my work [FL22-PRX Quantum]5 expanded these results further to encompass dynamic quantum resources applicable to important areas such as quantum error correction and quantum communication. Magic state distillation for fault-tolerant quantum computing (QIP talk) Quantum computing requires implementing a sequence of quantum gates, which serve as the building blocks for all quantum algorithms. However, a quantum computer that uses only Clifford gates would not be more powerful than a classical computer, as per the Gottesman-Knill theorem. To construct a universal quantum computer, we need to supplement Clifford gates with a specific type of state known as magic state. These states are named as such because they can turn what is essentially classical into quantum, much like a magic wand. The quality of magic states is crucial to the performance of quantum computational tasks; if it is too noisy, the computational results may be inaccurate. To address this issue, magic state distillation was introduced, and a long-standing open question in this area of research is whether we can distill a magic state using sub-logarithmic resources. Applying the no-go theorem for quantum resource distillation, my work [FL20-PRL]4 ","date":"2023-08-22","objectID":"/research/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/research/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Mathematical tools for quantum information processing The development of quantum information science often accompanies by a more thorough understanding of the mathematical framework underlying it. Of particular relevance are quantum entropies and optimization theories, which serve as valuable tools for analyzing quantum information processing. Quantum relative entropy in quantum data discrimination (QIP talk) Quantum relative entropies serve as quantum generalizations of the widely used Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing a measure to quantify the distinguishability between different quantum data. My works [FF21-CMP]15 [FFRS20-PRL]24 proved the chain rule properties of two major variants of quantum relative entropies, namely the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy and the Umegaki relative entropy. These results have established a crucial relationship between the entropy of a large quantum system and its individual subsystems, greatly generalizing the widely used quantum data processing inequalities. Remarkably, in [FF21-CMP]15, we addressed a critical open question raised by Wilde et al. in 25 and provided the first sequence of quantum applications of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy, sparking the community’s interest in this previously neglected quantity. As a result, numerous follow-up works have emerged in various domains, including quantum metrology26, quantum machine learning27, and even quantum field theory28. Furthermore, in [FFRS20-PRL]24, we solved an open question in the area of quantum channel discrimination29: namely, adaptive and non-adaptive discrimination strategies have exactly the same power in the asymmetric discrimination of quantum channels, negating the widely held ``mistaken intuition’’ that adaptive strategies have more discrimination power. Polynomial optimization and quantum entanglement verification The sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy is a series of increasingly tight relaxations of polynomial optimization problems and has profound impact in various fields, including control theory, statistics, and quantum information. Despite extensive research, the rate of convergence of the SOS hierarchy has yet to be fully understood30. Exploiting the polynomial kernel technique, my work [FF21-MP]31 provided the first quadratic improvement of the best-known convergence rate of the SOS hierarchy on the sphere since 199532, solving an important open problem in the optimization field33 and catalyzing subsequent breakthroughs on related topics 34 35. Furthermore, we established the first strict duality relationship between the SOS hierarchy and the well-known Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) hierarchy in quantum theory for quantum entanglement verification, thereby solidifying the connection between optimization theory and quantum information.

This requires hardware engineering to actually build the quantum system and software engineering to control hardware devices so as to run useful quantum algorithms. My focus is on the software aspect that runs on top of hardware devices and supports higher-level quantum applications. To fully tap into the unique features of quantum systems, quantum software must align with the principles of quantum physics and be optimized to a high degree, requiring expertise in both quantum information and software engineering. During my work at Baidu, I have successfully led multiple industrial projects that work coherently with the Baidu Quantum Platform, a full-stack quantum software and hardware platform developed by Baidu36. Efficient testbed for quantum internet Quantum internet is essentially a distributed network of quantum computers and devices. Such a network has the potential to surpass its classical counterpart in various aspects, including the efficiency of data transmission, the security of network services, and the capability of information processing. To accelerate research and development on quantum networks, we have developed QNET 37, an open-source software toolkit implemented in Python. It serves as a core component of the Baidu Quantum Platform and is the first quantum network toolkit that interfaces with real-world quantum computers. QNET is built upon a solid foundation of over 40 patent applications. The latest version, 1.4.0, comprises over 40 core modules, a vast repository of 25,000 lines of open-source code, 28 tutorials in both English and Chinese, a comprehensive API document, and a detailed white paper [FZLLD23-SCIS]38. The modular design of this toolkit provides flexibility for testing different quantum network architectures. In particular, we conducted a fine-grained simulation of a quantum key distribution experiment on the renowned Micius quantum satellite39, which demonstrated remarkable consistency with actual experimental data and underscored the effectiveness of QNET as a valuable testbed for future experiments. This toolkit has been presented at 2022 Baidu Create40 and reported by the mainstream news media in China at PingWest41, Toutiao42, QbitAI43, among others. Privacy-preserving quantum cloud service Consider a scenario in which a client seeks to run a quantum algorithm to solve a problem but lacks access to a quantum computer. In such a situation, the client might opt to utilize a quantum cloud service provided by a company. However, there may be concerns regarding entrusting the service provider with the confidentiality of the client’s algorithm and data. The blind quantum computation protocol offers a solution that empowers clients to leverage cloud services while safeguarding their privacy. Nonetheless, the protocol is intricate, necessitating interactive, real-time communication between the client and the server. It also involves the back-and-forth translation of the quantum circuit model to the measurement-based model. In this project44, we provided the first engineering implementation of the universal blind quantum computation protocol since its proposal in 200945. Our implementation automatically translates a user’s quantum circuit algorithm into the brickwork pattern and processes the computation interactively and in real-time between the user’s local PC and the cloud server. This project brings the remarkable privacy-preserving quantum computing scheme into practice and paves the way for its realization with actual quantum computers. New avenue for quantum machine learning Quantum machine learning is a burgeoning field that seeks to harness the computational power of quantum computers for more efficient problem-solving.

revolutionizing our lives. However, the inherent susceptibility of quantum systems to errors and noise effects in practical scenarios poses serious challenges to the implementation of quantum technologies. To put the theoretically blueprinted quantum advantages into use, scientists have devoted significant efforts to developing better and better methods for battling with noise. But meanwhile, our understanding about the theoretical limits to the performance of such methods under practical constraints, which may determine the ultimate efficiency of quantum technologies, is very limited.

Remarkably, these theorems allow us to establish the first rigorous understanding of the necessary resource costs of large-scale quantum computing.

We investigate these tasks in a unified framework of resource theory and focus on their computation and characterization with finite resources. Particularly we study the tradeoff among relevant parameters such as the number of resource copies, resource transformation rate, error tolerance and success probability. In the first part, we study the task of distillation for two different resources, maximally entangled state and maximally coherent state, representing nonlocal and local “quantumness” respectively. For entanglement distillation, we derive an efficiently computable second-order estimation of the distillation rate for general quantum states, which are tight for quantum states of practical interest. Our study overcomes the limitation of conventional research either focusing on the asymptotic rate or ignoring the computability. For the coherence distillation, we perform finite analysis for both deterministic and probabilistic scenarios. Our results unveil several new features of coherence from a resource theoretic viewpoint and contribute to an increased understanding of the fundamental properties of different sets of free operations. In the second part, we investigate the resource cost of simulating a quantum channel via quantum coherence or another quantum channel. We introduce the channel’s analogs of max-relative entropy, logarithmic robustness and max-information of quantum states, providing their operational interpretation with the channel simulation cost via different resources. Particularly, we establish the asymptotic equipartition property of the channel’s max-information, that is, it converges to the quantum mutual information of the channel in the independent and identically distributed asymptotic limit. As applications, this asymptotic equipartition property implies the quantum reverse Shannon theorem in the presence of non-signalling correlations. From the perspective of resource theory, the worth of a resource can usually be characterized by the minimum distance to a set of useless resources under a proper distance measure. We give such characterization for all the tasks studied in this thesis, and find that the distance measure for the distillation and simulation process naturally corresponds to the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy and the max-relative entropy, respectively.
