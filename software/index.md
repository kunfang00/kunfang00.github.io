# Quantum software

I have led several industrial projects, including the development of the first quantum network
toolkit with access to quantum hardware and the first simulator for quantum machine learning within the one-way quantum computer framework. As a tech lead, my responsibilities
encompass various aspects of project management, including team building, project initiation, development, launch, maintenance, and other related duties.


## QNET

QNET is an open-source quantum network toolkit and a core component of the Baidu Quantum Platform. It aims to accelerate the design of quantum network protocols, the testing of quantum network architectures, and the deployment of quantum internet standards.

QNET is the first quantum network toolkit with access to quantum hardware and it is built upon
a strong foundation of over 40 patent applications. The latest version, 1.4.0, comprises over 40
core modules, a vast repository of 25,000 lines of open-source code, 28 tutorials in both English
and Chinese, a comprehensive API document, and a detailed [white paper](/manuscript/FZLLD22-arxiv.pdf).

More details about QNET can be found on the [official website](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/qnet/tutorial-introduction), [GitHub](https://github.com/baidu/QCompute/tree/master/Extensions/QuantumNetwork), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qcompute-qnet/).

## MBQC

Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a universal quantum computing paradigm that differs from the widely used quantum circuit model. This project develops an efficient MBQC simulator and a transpiler that converts a quantum circuit into its MBQC equivalent. This project is a part of Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine learning toolkit, enabling the implementation of quantum machine learning within the MBQC (or one-way quantum computer) framework. 

More details about this project can be found on the [official website](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/measurement-based-quantum-computation/measurement-based-quantum-computation-module.html), [GitHub](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Quantum/tree/master/paddle_quantum/mbqc), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/paddle-quantum/).

## BQC

Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a cloud-based quantum computing scheme that enables users to perform private calculations without revealing information to the server. This project implements the universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol invented by Broadbent et al. in 2009. It automatically translates a user's quantum circuit algorithm into a brickwork pattern and processes the computation interactively and in real-time between a user's local PC and the cloud server. This is the first engineering implementation of the UBQC protocol and paves the way for its realization with actual quantum computers.
